❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a + b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` attempts to add variables `a` and `b` without them being defined within the function's scope or
passed as arguments. This will lead to errors when the function is executed because `a` and `b` are undefined.
* ❌ The function lacks input validation and error handling, which could lead to unexpected behavior if `a` or `b` are
not numbers.
* ❌ No JSDoc documentation.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
/**
* Sums two numbers.
*
* @param {number} a - The first number.
* @param {number} b - The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
* @throws {TypeError} If either a or b is not a number.
*/
function sum(a, b) {
if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
throw new TypeError('Both arguments must be numbers.');
}
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔️ The function now takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, allowing it to dynamically sum any two numbers passed to it.
* ✔️ Added type checking to ensure that both arguments are numbers.
* ✔️ Includes error handling to throw a `TypeError` if the arguments are not numbers.
* ✔️ JSDoc documentation added.
